count files by extension

```bash
find -type f -printf '%f\n' | awk '
{
split($1, a, ".");
ext = a[length(a)];
total_files[ext] += 1;
}
END {
for (ext in total_files) {
print ext, total_files[ext];
}
}'
```

good performance but how understand this syntax of awk :)
```bash
find . -name '?*.*' -type f -printf '%f\0' | gawk -F . -v RS='\0' '{n[$NF]++}
    END {
      PROCINFO["sorted_in"] = "@val_num_asc"
      for (e in n) printf "%4d %s\n", n[e], e
    }'
```

good one, but does not work well with file containing several dot
```bash
find . -type f  -printf '%f\n' | sed -e 's/.*\.//' | LC_COLLATE=C sort | uniq -c | sort -n
```
