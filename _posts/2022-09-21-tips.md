Some interesting ssh options.
We have two domains for lan and dmz servers and two differents accounts for ssh connections. With these options, `ssh host` without username and domain works. (ssh select the right username following the dns resolution of the host)

```bash
$ cat .ssh/config
CanonicalizeHostname yes
CanonicalDomains lan.net  dmz.net

Host *.lan.net
  User lanuser
Host *.dmz.net
  User dmzuser
```

do not ask for accepting new ssh key
```bash
Host *
   HostKeyAlgorithms +ssh-dss
   StrictHostKeyChecking=accept-new
```
